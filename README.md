      (9)Industry,innovation and infrastruture
6. Write a short description of your project.  

   Basically it's a idea of smart work rather than hard work. It saves water ,hardwork of farmers....it is a iot based project containing sensors and Arduino as main components.It checks the moisture level  and accordingly water the crops

7. What does your project solve? 

   It is not always possible for one person to be able to keep track of the entire farmland all the time. Sometimes it may happen that a given patch of land receives more water leading to water-logging, or it might receive far less or no water at all leading to dry soil, So,our project solves this problem with small equipment in a efficeint way.

8. Challenges you ran into during the hackathon.  

   nothing much just few network issues from our end while interacting with our teammates

9. Technologies used for the project 

   IOT(Internet of Things)

10. Link for Video / ppt showing how the prototype works ( be as creative and innovative as possible ).
